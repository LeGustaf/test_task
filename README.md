# 2D Contour Test Task

A lightweight, modular C++ library for representing and manipulating 2D contours made of line and arc segments.  
Includes full Doxygen documentation and unit tests.

## Features

- `Contour2D`: A flexible container for line/arc segments
- `LineSegment2D` and `ArcSegment2D`: Derive from a shared `Segment2D` interface
- `MyPoint`: Simple 3D point class with 2D/3D distance methods
- Utility to build polylines from a point list
- Caching-based contour validity checks
- Fully documented with Doxygen
